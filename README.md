JJB specs for Aether integration tests

Jenkins Job Builder takes simple descriptions of Jenkins_ jobs in YAML_ or JSON_
format and uses them to configure Jenkins. You can keep your job descriptions in
human readable text format in a version control system to make changes and
auditing easier. It also has a flexible template system, so creating many
similarly configured jobs is easy.

To install::

    $ pip install --user jenkins-job-builder
